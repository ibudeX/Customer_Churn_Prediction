        "### What is Machine Learning?\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine Learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine teaching a child to recognize different types of fruits. Instead of giving them a list of rules, you show them many pictures of apples, oranges, and bananas. Over time, the child learns to identify these fruits on their own. Machine learning works in a similar way.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Real World Applications of Machine Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine learning is used everywhere in our daily lives:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Email Spam Detection: Your email provider uses machine learning to identify spam emails and move them to your spam folder.\n",
        "- Recommendation Systems: Netflix suggests movies you might like, and Amazon recommends products based on your browsing history.\n",
        "- Voice Assistants: Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use machine learning to understand your voice commands.\n",
        "- Medical Diagnosis: Doctors use machine learning to detect diseases from medical images and predict patient outcomes.\n",
        "- Financial Fraud Detection: Banks use machine learning to identify fraudulent transactions and protect your money.\n",
        "- Human Resources: Companies use machine learning to predict which customers might leave and take action to retain valuable talent.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Our Project: Predicting Bank Customer Churn\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we will build machine learning models to predict whether an customer will leave the bank or stay. This problem is called credit card default prediction or customer default rate prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Customer default is when an customer voluntarily leaves a bank. For organizations, understanding which customers are likely to leave helps them:\n",
        "- Take proactive steps to retain valuable customers\n",
        "- Improve credit card conditions and customer satisfaction\n",
        "- Plan for recruitment and training needs\n",
        "- Reduce the costs associated with customer default rate\n",
        "\n",
        "Customer default rate is expensive. Studies show that replacing an customer can cost 50-200% of their annual salary when you factor in recruitment, training, and lost productivity.\n",

        "\n",
        "Our dataset contains information about bank customers. Here is what each column means:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer. This is like an customer number that helps the bank keep track of individual customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Age: The age of the customer in years. Research shows that age can be related to default patterns.\n",

        "3. Gender: Whether the customer is Male or Female.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. MaritalStatus: The marital status of the customer. This can be Single, Married, or Divorced.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Education: The education level of the customer on a scale from 1 to 5:\n",
        "   - 1 = Below College\n",
        "   - 2 = College\n",
        "   - 3 = Bachelor degree\n",
        "   - 4 = Master degree\n",

        "\n",
        "10. YearsInCurrentRole: How many years the customer has been in their current position. Being in the same role too long might lead to frustration.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. YearsSinceLastPromotion: How many years since the customer was last promoted. Long periods without promotion can lead to dissatisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. NumCompaniesWorked: The number of companies the customer worked for before joining the current bank. Frequent job changes might indicate a pattern.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "16. WorkLifeBalance: How the customer rates their work-life balance on a scale from 1 to 4:\n",
        "    - 1 = Bad\n",
        "    - 2 = Good\n",

        "\n",
        "18. TrainingTimesLastYear: The number of training sessions the customer attended in the last year. Training opportunities can improve risk management.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. OverTime: Whether the customer works overtime. Yes means they work overtime, No means they don't. Excessive overtime can lead to burnout.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. StockOptionLevel: The level of stock options the customer has:\n",
        "    - 0 = None\n",

        "    - Travel_Rarely: Occasional travel\n",
        "    - Travel_Frequently: Frequent travel required\n",
        "\n",

If the exam only had the exact same questions you practiced, you might do well but it wouldn't truly test your understanding. Similarly, we test our model on new data it hasn't seen to check if it really learned the patterns or just memorized the training data.\n",

        "Accuracy = (Correct Predictions) / (Total Predictions)\n",

        "For example, if our model made 100 predictions and 85 were correct, the accuracy is 85%.\n",

        "### What is Logistic Regression?\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite having \"regression\" in its name, Logistic Regression is actually used for classification problems. It's one of the simplest and most widely used machine learning algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Intuition\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you want to predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on the number of hours they studied. Logistic Regression draws an S-shaped curve (called a sigmoid curve) that transforms the hours studied into a probability between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the probability is above 0.5, we predict pass. If it's below 0.5, we predict fail.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our case, Logistic Regression looks at features like job satisfaction, overtime, and years at bank, and calculates the probability that an customer will leave.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How It Works Step by Step\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The algorithm assigns weights to each feature. Features that are more important get higher weights.\n",
        "2. It multiplies each feature by its weight and adds them up.\n",
        "3. This sum is transformed using a mathematical function to get a probability between 0 and 1.\n",
        "4. If the probability is greater than 0.5, the model predicts the customer will leave. Otherwise, it predicts they will stay.\n",
        "5. The algorithm learns the best weights by adjusting them to minimize prediction errors on the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use Logistic Regression\n",
        "\n",
        "- When you need a simple, interpretable model\n",
        "- When you want to understand which features are most important\n",
        "- When you have a binary classification problem (two categories)\n",
        "- When you need fast training and prediction\n",
        "- When the relationship between features and target is relatively linear\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strengths\n",
        "\n",
        "- Easy to understand and interpret\n",
        "- Fast to train and make predictions\n",
        "- Works well when the decision boundary is linear\n",
        "- Provides probability estimates, not just class predictions\n",
        "- Less prone to overfitting with small datasets\n",
        "\n",
        "### Weaknesses\n",
        "\n",
        "- Assumes a linear relationship between features and the target\n",
        "- May not perform well with complex patterns in the data\n",
        "- Cannot automatically learn feature interactions\n",
        "- Performance can be limited on datasets with complex relationships\n",

        "\n",
        "### What is a Decision Tree?\n",
        "\n",
        "A Decision Tree is a machine learning algorithm that makes decisions by asking a series of yes/no questions. It's like playing a game of 20 questions to identify something.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Intuition\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you are an bank manager trying to identify which customers might leave. You might ask:\n",
        "- Is their job satisfaction low? If yes, they might leave. If no, continue.\n",
        "- Do they work overtime? If yes, they might leave. If no, continue.\n",
        "- Have they been here less than 2 years? If yes, they might leave. If no, they'll likely stay.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Decision Tree works the same way. It asks questions about the data and makes decisions based on the answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How It Works Step by Step\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The algorithm starts with all the data at the top of the tree (called the root).\n",
        "2. It finds the best feature and value to split the data. For example, \"Is JobSatisfaction less than 2?\"\n",
        "3. It divides the data into two groups based on this question.\n",
        "4. It repeats this process for each group, creating more branches.\n",
        "5. It stops splitting when it reaches a stopping condition, such as:\n",
        "   - All customers in a group have the same outcome (all leave or all stay)\n",
        "   - The tree reaches a maximum depth\n",
        "   - There are too few customers left to split further\n",
        "6. The final groups at the bottom are called leaves, and they contain the predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use Decision Trees\n",
        "\n",
        "- When you need an interpretable model that's easy to explain\n",
        "- When you want to visualize how decisions are made\n",
        "- When your data has both numerical and categorical features\n",
        "- When feature relationships are non-linear\n",
        "- When you don't want to spend time on feature scaling or normalization\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strengths\n",
        "\n",
        "- Very easy to understand and interpret\n",
        "- Can be visualized as a flowchart\n",
        "- Handles both numerical and categorical data\n",
        "- Doesn't require feature scaling\n",
        "- Automatically learns feature interactions\n",
        "- Can capture non-linear patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "### Weaknesses\n",
        "\n",
        "- Prone to overfitting (memorizing training data instead of learning patterns)\n",
        "- Can create overly complex trees that don't generalize well\n",
        "- Small changes in data can lead to very different trees\n",
        "- May not perform as well as ensemble methods\n",
        "- Can be biased toward features with more categories\n",

        "## Algorithm 3: Random Forest\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is a Random Forest?\n",
        "\n",
        "A Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple Decision Trees to make better predictions. The name \"forest\" comes from the fact that we're creating many trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Intuition\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you want to make an important bank decision, like whether to invest in risk management efforts for an customer. Instead of asking just one manager, you ask ten managers for their opinions and then go with the majority vote. This usually gives you a better decision than relying on just one person.\n",
        "\n",
        "Random Forest works the same way. It creates many Decision Trees, each trained on a slightly different subset of the data. When making a prediction, it asks all the trees for their opinion and uses majority voting to make the final decision.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How It Works Step by Step\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Create multiple Decision Trees (typically 100 or more).\n",
        "2. For each tree:\n",
        "   - Randomly select a subset of the training data (with replacement). This is called bootstrap sampling.\n",
        "   - Randomly select a subset of features to consider at each split.\n",
        "   - Train a Decision Tree on this subset.\n",
        "3. To make a prediction for a new customer:\n",
        "   - Pass the customer's data through all the trees.\n",
        "   - Each tree gives its prediction (leave or stay).\n",
        "   - Take a majority vote. If more trees predict default, the final prediction is default.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Does This Work Better?\n",
        "\n",
        "Each individual tree might make mistakes, but they make different mistakes because they're trained on different subsets of data and features. When we combine them, the errors tend to cancel out, leading to better overall predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use Random Forest\n",
        "\n",
        "- When you want high accuracy\n",
        "- When you need a robust model that's less prone to overfitting\n",
        "- When you have enough computational resources (Random Forest is slower than single trees)\n",
        "- When interpretability is less important than performance\n",
        "- When working with tabular data\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strengths\n",
        "\n",
        "- Generally very accurate\n",
        "- Reduces overfitting compared to single Decision Trees\n",
        "- Works well with both numerical and categorical features\n",
        "- Handles missing values well\n",
        "- Provides feature importance measures\n",
        "- Requires less parameter tuning than other algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "### Weaknesses\n",
        "\n",
        "- Less interpretable than single Decision Trees\n",
        "- Slower to train and predict than single trees\n",
        "- Requires more memory to store multiple trees\n",
        "- Can be slower for real-time predictions\n",
        "- May not perform well on very noisy data\n",
        "\n",

        "Imagine you are learning to predict credit card default:\n",
        "1. You make your first attempt and identify some customers who will leave, but miss others.\n",
        "2. For your second attempt, you focus specifically on the customers you got wrong before.\n",
        "3. You continue this process, each time focusing on your remaining mistakes.\n",
        "4. By the end, the combination of all your attempts gives you a very accurate prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient Boosting works similarly. Each tree focuses on the mistakes of previous trees, gradually improving the overall predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How It Works Step by Step\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Start with a simple initial prediction (usually the average).\n",
        "2. Build a small Decision Tree that predicts the errors from step 1.\n",
        "3. Add this tree's predictions to the initial predictions to get improved predictions.\n",
        "4. Build another tree that predicts the remaining errors.\n",
        "5. Add this new tree's predictions to improve predictions further.\n",
        "6. Repeat steps 4-5 for a specified number of trees (typically 100-1000).\n",
        "7. The final prediction is the sum of all tree predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each tree is relatively small and weak (they're called \"weak learners\"), but when combined, they create a powerful \"strong learner.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use Gradient Boosting\n",
        "\n",
        "- When you need very high accuracy\n",
        "- When you have structured/tabular data\n",
        "- When you can afford longer training times\n",
        "- When you're participating in machine learning competitions\n",
        "- When you have sufficient data and computational resources\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strengths\n",
        "\n",
        "- Often achieves the highest accuracy among traditional ML algorithms\n",
        "- Handles different types of data well\n",
        "- Can capture complex patterns\n",
        "- Provides feature importance\n",
        "- Less prone to overfitting than individual trees (with proper tuning)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Weaknesses\n",
        "\n",
        "- Slower to train than Random Forest\n",
        "- Requires careful tuning of parameters\n",
        "- Can overfit if not properly configured\n",
        "- Sensitive to outliers\n",
        "- Less interpretable than simpler models\n",
        "- Trains sequentially, so cannot be parallelized as easily as Random Forest\n",

        "\n",
        "### What is XGBoost?\n",
        "\n",
        "XGBoost stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting. It's an optimized and highly efficient implementation of gradient boosting. XGBoost has become one of the most popular machine learning algorithms because it consistently wins machine learning competitions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Intuition\n",
        "\n",
        "XGBoost works on the same principle as Gradient Boosting (correcting previous mistakes), but it includes several improvements:\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of Gradient Boosting as a good bank analyst who learns from mistakes. XGBoost is like a brilliant analyst who not only learns from mistakes but also:\n",
        "- Has better analytical techniques\n",
        "- Works more efficiently\n",
        "- Knows when to stop analyzing (avoids overfitting)\n",
        "- Can analyze multiple aspects simultaneously (parallelization)\n",
        "\n",
        "### How XGBoost Improves on Gradient Boosting\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Regularization: XGBoost includes built-in penalties to prevent overfitting, making the model more robust.\n",
        "2. Handling Missing Values: XGBoost can automatically learn the best way to handle missing data.\n",
        "3. Parallel Processing: While trees are built sequentially, XGBoost can parallelize operations within each tree, making it faster.\n",
        "4. Tree Pruning: XGBoost uses a more sophisticated method to decide when to stop growing trees.\n",
        "5. Built-in Cross-Validation: XGBoost can perform cross-validation during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use XGBoost\n",
        "\n",
        "- When you need top performance on structured/tabular data\n",
        "- When you're working on a machine learning competition\n",
        "- When you have sufficient computational resources\n",
        "- When you need to handle missing values\n",
        "- When you want a model that's less prone to overfitting\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strengths\n",
        "\n",
        "- Typically achieves the best performance on structured data\n",
        "- Fast training due to parallel processing\n",
        "- Built-in regularization prevents overfitting\n",
        "- Handles missing values automatically\n",
        "- Provides excellent feature importance measures\n",
        "- Highly customizable with many parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "### Weaknesses\n",
        "\n",
        "- Can be complex to tune properly\n",
        "- Requires understanding of many hyperparameters\n",
        "- May be overkill for simple problems\n",
        "- Less interpretable than simpler models\n",
        "- Requires installation of separate library\n",

        "\n",
        "### What is LightGBM?\n",
        "\n",
        "LightGBM is another advanced implementation of gradient boosting, developed by Microsoft. The \"Light\" in its name refers to its fast training speed and low memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Intuition\n",
        "\n",
        "If XGBoost is a brilliant analyst, LightGBM is a brilliant analyst who is also incredibly efficient. It's not just smart, it's also remarkably fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key difference in how LightGBM builds trees is that it grows trees leaf-wise instead of level-wise:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Level-wise (used by most algorithms): Grow all nodes at the same level before moving to the next level.\n",
        "- Leaf-wise (used by LightGBM): Always split the leaf that will give the maximum reduction in loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like this: Instead of reviewing all customers at each level of analysis, LightGBM focuses on wherever the analysis will improve the most, which might mean completing one area before touching others.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How LightGBM Is Different\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Leaf-wise tree growth leads to better accuracy but can overfit if not careful.\n",
        "2. Uses histogram-based algorithms to bin continuous features, making it faster.\n",
        "3. Can handle large datasets very efficiently.\n",
        "4. Supports categorical features directly without encoding.\n",
        "5. Uses gradient-based sampling to focus on harder examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "### When to Use LightGBM\n",
        "\n",
        "- When you have a large dataset and need fast training\n",
        "- When memory is limited\n",
        "- When you need high accuracy\n",
        "- When you have categorical features\n",
        "- When you want to try an alternative to XGBoost\n",
        "\n",
        "### Strengths\n",
        "\n",
        "- Extremely fast training speed\n",
        "- Low memory usage\n",
        "- Often achieves better accuracy than XGBoost\n",
        "- Handles large datasets efficiently\n",
        "- Supports categorical features natively\n",
        "- Provides good feature importance measures\n",
        "\n",
        "### Weaknesses\n",
        "\n",
        "- More prone to overfitting on small datasets\n",
        "- Sensitive to hyperparameter tuning\n",
        "- Less stable than XGBoost on small datasets\n",
        "- Requires understanding of its unique parameters\n",
        "- May be too complex for simple problems\n",
